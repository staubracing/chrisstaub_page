        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Manufacturing Engineer with proven expertise in process validation,
          root cause analysis, and lean improvement within regulated medical
          device environments. Blending hands-on engineering with modern
          development tools, I design and integrate digital solutions that
          enhance production efficiency and data reliability. Recently led the
          modernization of the Access Point Vascular (APV) mobile application
          using React Native, TypeScript, and AWS serverless architecture,
          demonstrating a strong bridge between manufacturing operations and
          software-driven process optimization.
