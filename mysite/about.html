    <h2>The Essentials</h2>

    <p>
        I'm Christopher, your go-to guy for all things engineering and racing on two wheels!
        <br>By day, I'm immersed in the world of manufacturing engineering, ensuring aircrafts are mechanically sound
        and
        ready to soar the skies.
        <br>When I'm not surrounded by gears and metal, you'll find me chasing the horizon on my sportbike or supermoto,
        embracing the adrenaline rush that comes with road racing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently, I'm diving headfirst into the realms of coding, web development, and cloud systems with AWS.
        <br>With JavaScript, Solidity, Node.js, npm, and hardhat as my companions, I'm on a mission to conquer the
        digital
        realm, one line of code at a time.
        <br>My ambition? To master the art of Blockchain development, web3, and software development, painting the
        digital
        canvas with innovative solutions
    </p>

    <p>
        In this journey of self-improvement, I also aim to elevate my physical and mental prowess.
        <br>The rhythm of Tool, Primus, and Frank Zappa, intertwined with the soothing notes of jazz, fuels my
        determination
        and creativity.
        <br><br>As a Dune enthusiast, I resonate with the phrase "Fear is the mind killer" and strive to face every
        challenge head-on with a composed mind and a spirited heart
