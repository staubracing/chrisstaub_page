    <h2>The Essentials</h2>

    <p>
      I'm Christopher, your go-to guy for all things engineering and racing on
      two wheels!
      <br />By day, I'm immersed in the world of manufacturing engineering,
      ensuring aircrafts are mechanically sound and ready to soar the skies.
      <br />When I'm not surrounded by gears and metal, you'll find me chasing
      the horizon on my sportbike or supermoto, embracing the adrenaline rush
      that comes with road racing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I'm diving headfirst into the realms of coding, web
      development, and cloud systems with AWS.
      <br />With JavaScript, Solidity, Node.js, npm, and hardhat as my
      companions, I'm on a mission to conquer the digital realm, one line of
      code at a time. <br />My ambition? To master the art of Blockchain
      development, web3, and software development, painting the digital canvas
      with innovative solutions
    </p>

    <p>
      In this journey of self-improvement, I also aim to elevate my physical and
      mental prowess.
      <br />The rhythm of Tool, Primus, and Frank Zappa, intertwined with the
      soothing notes of jazz, fuels my determination and creativity.
      <br /><br />As a Dune enthusiast, I resonate with the phrase "Fear is the
      mind killer" and strive to face every challenge head-on with a composed
      mind and a spirited heart
