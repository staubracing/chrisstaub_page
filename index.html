    <h2>The Essentials</h2>

    <p>
      I'm Christopher, a dedicated professional in engineering and motorcycle
      racing.
      <br />By day, I work as a manufacturing engineer in the medical device
      industry, ensuring products meet the highest standards of safety and
      reliability. <br />Outside of work, I enjoy motorcycle racing, embracing
      the thrill and precision it requires.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I'm expanding my skills in coding, web development, and cloud
      systems with AWS.
      <br />I am currently learning JavaScript, React (native too), Node.js, and
      AWS, and I am committed to advancing my expertise in software development.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am also focused on personal growth, both physically and mentally.
      <br />Music, including Tool, Primus, and Frank Zappa, along with jazz,
      inspires my creativity and determination. <br /><br />As a fan of Dune, I
      embrace the philosophy "Fear is the mind killer" and approach challenges
      with a calm and determined mindset.
